			<p>Hello! This is my Portfolio page. Herein you will find projects I've completed for clients as well as self study/fulfillment.</p>
			<p>I am largely a self-taught developer, with an internship, some freelance, and some schooling under my belt. Over the last three years, I have invested significant effort into self-study, focusing largely on web development. My love of problem solving, design analysis, and creative expression through structure has driven my journey from professional cook to software developer.</p>

					<h3 style="text-align: center; margin-top: 12px;">Click to see me live on the web!</h3>
				</a>

				<div class="column-container">
					<div class="column">
						<h3>Features</h3>
						<ul>
							<li>Custom, fully responsive theme built to UI/UX docs from project lead and PSD's from visual designer. Started from the base theme over at <a href="www.underscores.me">Underscores.me</a></li>
							<li>Custom mods to WooCommerce checkout to move process to two-step flow</li>
							<li>Custom post types with custom fields for easy editing on the back-end admin pages</li>
							<li>JavaSript and PHP AJAX handlers for interactive shop page built to drive purchases</li>
						</ul>
					</div>	

					
					<div class="column">
						<h3>Challenges</h3>
						<ul>
							<li>The fully responsive checkout and cart pages took quite a bit of digging into how things were generated inside WooCommerce/WordPress core</li>
							<li>Coming up with a scheme to deliver the two-step process for our checkout page that meets mobile-responsive criteria was a doozy. I would love to talk about my approach if you're interested!</li>
							<li>First truly deep-dive into WordPress, and first time using WooCommerce/building e-commerce in general</li>
							<li>Managing a local development environment, a staging server on AWS, and finally a live site on GoDaddy accurately</li>
						</ul>
					</div>	

					
					<div class="column c-end">
						<h3>Afterthoughts</h3>
						<p>This project was huge for me. I bit off significantly more than I had originally thought. Turns out it's a bigger deal than it would first appear, digging into WordPress and WooCommerce core to implement a fully custom and responsive site. I had fun juggling when and how to implement plugins, how to write any modifications to those plugins such that updates won't break anything, building out a backend that was usable for my client down the road, and a ton of bits and pieces of what goes into pulling off a more complex project built on a CMS. I can't believe how much the project taught me through frustration and success -- but now I've got all of this under my belt and feel immensely more competent throughout the entire process.</p>

						<h3>The Tech</h3>
						<p>At Windocks, we built a Windows Server 2012 Containerization solution for production and dev/test use, utilizing a port of the Docker daemon's GoLang codebase to Windows, interfacing with a C++ layer, into an open-sourced container solution built by Uhuru Software and expanded upon by us on the WinDocks team.</p>
						<p>My time and involvement saw the product from early design and development through to integration with F500 NetApp's data fabric commercial offering.</p> 
					</div>	

					<div class="column">
						<h3>Some of my contributions</h3>
						<ul>
							<li>Designed, implemented and debugged our database attachment dockerfile commands, for local clone or remote NAS</li>
							<li>Wrote a registry template to expand our MsSQL support to include SQL 2012</li>
							<li>Debugged and streamlined Prison User management for our containers - creation, permissions, cleanup in registry & file locking</li>
							<li>Redesigned the company logo</li>
							<li>Managed all the in-office infrastructure -- set up test server(s), multiple partitions with varied setups, set up a network domain for testing, wrote install scripts to automate Windows Server 2012 install and WinDocks deployment</li>
							<li>Created our AWS Test Drive offerings as well as multiple AMI's as ready-to-use packages</li>
							<li>Wrote and revised documentation</li>
							<li>Designed and built our original tech demo and subsequent integration demo scripting</li>
						</ul>
					</div>
					
					<div class="column c-end">
						<h3>Core Technology Exposure</h3>
						<ul>
							<li>C#, C++, .NET libraries</li>
							<li>PowerShell and BASH</li>
							<li>Visual Studio 2012 Professional</li>
							<li>Dev & Debugging tools like Handle, ProcMon</li>
							<li>Windows Server 2012 & 2012r2, IIS 8</li>
							<li>Amazon Web Services' EC2 offerings</li>
							<li>Microsoft Office Interop DLL Libraries</li>
							<li>Windows Registry and User Account Control [programmatic manipulation]</li>

				</a>

				<div class="column-container">
					<div class="column">
						<h3>Features</h3>
						<ul>
							<li>Snappy, responsive hand-written JavaScript handlers to navigate between tabs and sections. Meaning after initial load there is zero delay navigating to any other page/section</li>
							<li>Clean, semantic HTML/CSS</li>
							<li>100% from-scratch code</li>
						</ul>
					</div>	

					
					<div class="column">
						<h3>Challenges</h3>
						<ul>
							<li>The javascript handlers took a hot minute to figure out. It was a sincere challenge trying to design class names, and functions, that could talk to each other nicely - and that in the end look so simple</li>
							<li>Coming up with a scheme for my Divs and elements such that the JS could work well with the flow of the page</li>
							<li>This is the first site that I've built around an image, for someone else. It's hopefully close to finish and will be populated with real content soon</li>
						</ul>
					</div>	

					
					<div class="column c-end">
						<h3>Afterthoughts</h3>
						<p>I would very much like to take the scripts handling navigation and bundle them up cleanly into easily bound functions as a jQuery plugin for distribution. It's on the to-do list at some point as/when I get some time between school and work!! But I think that there's something quite usable there in the right informational and design contexts and would prove a fantastic learning experience. I'm also only slightly satisfied with the font of the main logo; I realized through this build that I'd very much like to spend time familiarizing myself with design, typography and fine-tuning my style and site structures. Starting to see my studies come together though.</p>

			<h2>Project: Javascript/jQuery Etchasketch</h2>
			<section id="etchasketch">

				<!-- begin etchasketch 
					 etchasketch container is empty 
					 until populated by sketch.js -->
				<div id="button-wrap">
					<p>SQUARES PER SIDE: 
						<input type="text" value="16" id="gridSize" name="gridSize">
					</p>
					
					<button type="button" id="newGrid">New Grid</button>
				</div>			

				<div id="sketch-wrap"></div>
				<!-- end etchasketch -->

				

				<p>Another fun one to implement! This was an exercise in programmatically writing HTML using jQuery, and binding event handlers to said HTML.</p> 
				
				<h3>Features:</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>Adds 20% opacity to elements on each mouseover</li>
					<li>Customizable resolution! Giv'er a shot.</li>
				</ul>

				<h3>Challenges:</h3>
				<ul>
					<li><strike>Not all resolutions divide 400x400 cleanly. If you enter a grid dimension that is not a factor of 400, you end up with a 1 pixel column of whitespace on the right.</strike> Fixed by setting box-sizing: border-box on all page elements in pages CSS</li>
					<li>The whole project was a bit of a flex for me -- planning out how to deal with styles and bind events to elements that aren't in the HTML until the page loads was a bit frustrating, but very satisfying upon completion.</li>
